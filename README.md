# Job Prioritisation Exercise
Exercise using TDD and Ruby to solve a hypothetical scenario to arrange a given string of jobs into the correct order.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository `git clone git@github.com:drobny/job_prioritisation_exercise.git`.

2. `cd job_prioritisation_exercise` and `bundle install` (assuming bundler is already installed). I am using Ruby 2.3 if you don't have RVM installed.

3. Run `bin/rspec` to run the tests.
